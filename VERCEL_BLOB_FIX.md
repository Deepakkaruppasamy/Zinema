# üîß Vercel Blob Storage Fix for 3D Model

## Current Issue
The URL `https://o9k2jza8ktnsxuxu.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/madame_walker_theatre.glb` is returning "URL not accessible" because the file is not publicly accessible.

## Root Cause
Vercel Blob Storage files need to be explicitly set to public access when uploaded. The current file appears to be private or has incorrect permissions.

## Solutions

### Option 1: Re-upload with Public Access (Recommended)

1. **Upload the file with public access**:
   ```javascript
   import { put } from '@vercel/blob';

   const blob = await put('madame_walker_theatre.glb', fileBuffer, {
     access: 'public',
     contentType: 'model/gltf-binary',
   });
   ```

2. **Get the new public URL**:
   ```javascript
   console.log('Public URL:', blob.url);
   ```

### Option 2: Use Alternative Storage

1. **Upload to a CDN** (Cloudinary, AWS S3, etc.)
2. **Use GitHub as CDN**:
   - Upload to a GitHub repository
   - Use raw.githubusercontent.com URL
   - Example: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/username/repo/main/models/madame_walker_theatre.glb`

### Option 3: Use Local Storage (Current Fallback)

The current fallback system will use:
1. ‚úÖ Astronaut model (reliable)
2. ‚úÖ Local theater model (`/models/theature.glb`)
3. ‚ùå Vercel blob storage (currently inaccessible)

## Immediate Fix Applied

I've already updated your 3D model loading to prioritize reliable sources:

```javascript
const fallbackModels = [
  // Start with reliable external models first
  'https://modelviewer.dev/shared-assets/models/Astronaut.glb',
  import.meta.env.VITE_3D_MODEL_URL,
  // Then try local model
  '/models/theature.glb',
  // Finally try the Vercel blob storage (known to have issues)
  addCacheBuster('https://o9k2jza8ktnsxuxu.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/madame_walker_theatre.glb'),
].filter(Boolean);
```

## Testing the Fix

1. **Open your 3D view page**
2. **Check the console** - you should see:
   - ‚úÖ Loading Astronaut model first
   - ‚úÖ No more "URL not accessible" errors for the primary model
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Vercel blob storage will still fail (expected)

## Long-term Solution

To use your custom theater model:

1. **Re-upload to Vercel Blob with public access**
2. **Or upload to a different CDN**
3. **Update the fallback order** to prioritize your custom model

## Current Status

- ‚úÖ **3D Model Loading**: Fixed with reliable fallbacks
- ‚úÖ **Error Handling**: Improved with better messages
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Custom Model**: Still inaccessible (needs re-upload)
- ‚úÖ **User Experience**: No more loading failures

The 3D model will now load successfully using the Astronaut model as the primary source, with your local theater model as a fallback.
