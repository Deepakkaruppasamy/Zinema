# üîß Troubleshooting 502 Errors - DeepAI Still Not Working

## **Current Issue:** Still getting 502 errors after adding API key

---

## **Step 1: Check if Deployment Actually Completed** ‚è≥

### In your Render dashboard:
1. **Click "Events" tab**
2. **Look for recent deployment**
3. **Verify it shows "Deploy succeeded"**
4. **Check timestamp** - should be after you added the API key

### If deployment is still in progress:
- Wait for it to complete (can take 3-5 minutes)
- Don't test until you see "Deploy succeeded"

### If no new deployment started:
- Click **"Manual Deploy"** ‚Üí **"Deploy latest commit"**
- Wait for completion

## **Step 2: Test Health Endpoint Directly** üîç

**Open this URL in a new browser tab:**
```
https://zinema-clvk.onrender.com/api/deepai/health
```

### Expected Results:

#### ‚úÖ **SUCCESS (API key working):**
```json
{
  "status": "configured",
  "hasApiKey": true,
  "modelName": "gemini-1.5-pro-002",
  "message": "DeepAI service is properly configured"
}
```

#### ‚ùå **STILL MISSING (need to check config):**
```json
{
  "status": "missing_api_key",
  "hasApiKey": false,
  "message": "GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable is not set"
}
```

#### üîß **MODEL ISSUE:**
```json
{
  "error": "Gemini model not found",
  "detail": "Model gemini-1.5-pro-002 is not available"
}
```

## **Step 3: Common Issues & Solutions** üõ†Ô∏è

### Issue 1: Deployment Didn't Complete
**Solution:** 
- Check Events tab for "Deploy succeeded"
- If stuck, click "Manual Deploy"

### Issue 2: Environment Variable Not Saved
**Solution:**
- Go back to Environment tab
- Verify `GEMINI_API_KEY` is listed
- If missing, add it again and save

### Issue 3: Wrong Model Name
**Solution:**
- Change `GEMINI_MODEL` from `gemini-1.5-pro-002` to `gemini-1.5-pro`
- The `-002` suffix might not be supported

### Issue 4: API Key Issue
**Solution:**
- Verify the key is exactly: `AIzaSyAC11SMd2r8EAmHlXO5ZgjBKPa3ulN0GlU`
- No extra spaces or characters

## **Step 4: Quick Fix Actions** ‚ö°

### Action 1: Update Model Name (Recommended)
1. Go to Render ‚Üí Environment tab
2. Edit `GEMINI_MODEL` variable
3. Change value to: `gemini-1.5-pro` (remove the `-002`)
4. Save changes and wait for redeploy

### Action 2: Force Manual Deploy
1. Go to Render dashboard
2. Click "Manual Deploy"
3. Select "Deploy latest commit"
4. Wait for "Deploy succeeded"

### Action 3: Check Logs
1. Click "Logs" tab in Render
2. Look for error messages about GEMINI_API_KEY
3. Check for any Gemini API errors

---

## **Step 5: Test After Each Fix** ‚úÖ

After each change:
1. Wait for deployment to complete
2. Test health URL: `https://zinema-clvk.onrender.com/api/deepai/health`
3. If shows "configured", test your app
4. If still shows "missing_api_key", try next solution

---

## **Most Likely Issue:** üéØ

The model name `gemini-1.5-pro-002` might not be valid. Try changing it to just `gemini-1.5-pro`.
